# libretto
Scripts to create an HTML autoscrolling web page for opera libretti

This project was created for an opera listening party so that we could all have the libretto displayed
while listening to a recording of The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs.  The scripts were written to process
a plain-text version of the libretto that was copy-pasted from the PDF version of the album booklet
with minimal manual processing.  Aside from fixing some text ordering and new lines artifacts introduced
from the copying, the only additional work done on the text representation was fine tuning timing markup.
As a result, the libretto format started off pretty loose, and time constraints led to some shortcuts
out of necessity.  Future work will include formalizing the libretto format and making more robust
formatting control available to the output.
